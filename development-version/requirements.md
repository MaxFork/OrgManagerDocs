title: OrgManager Developer Version Requirements
---

To install and run the OrgManager Development Version, you'll need:

- A web server of your choice - (We recommend [hotel](https://github.com/typicode/hotel) for development, as it is easy to setup and doesn't require any configuration.)
- PHP - (At least v5.6.4, although v7.* is recommended. [Installing PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php))
- Some PHP libraries - (OpenSSL, PDO, Mbstring, Tokenizer, XML) (Google is your friend :smile:)
- Composer - ([Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/))
- MySQL database - ([You can get one online for free](https://www.google.com/search?q=free+mysql+database), although it's always better to work locally :smile:)
- Git - ([Install GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
