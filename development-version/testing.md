title: Testing the OrgManager Development Version
---

We use the Laravel testing functionalities and PHPUnit to add automated testing to OrgManager.

## Setting up the testing enviroment
By default, the tests will run in a special database called `orgmanager_test` in `localhost` with username `root` and password `root`. If you need to change this, edit the `.env.testing` file. This is an example of a customized `.env.testing` file:

``` env
APP_ENV=testing # don't change this!
APP_KEY=base64:GIkaQ57IIVtTeTQOIh7eAFo1FAcoWkfwYPkfcOyusW4= # this is autogenerated

DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=:memory:

CACHE_DRIVER=array # you shouldn't need to change this
SESSION_DRIVER=array # you shouldn't need to change this
QUEUE_DRIVER=sync # you shouldn't need to change this
```

Once you've customized your .env.testing file, you have to migrate the database to your test database. You can do this by running 

``` bash
php artisan migrate --env=testing
```

# Running the tests
To run the tests, run

``` bash
composer test
```
