title: About the OrgManager Hosted Version
---

Not everyone can afford a server, nor do they have the skills to set up a modern PHP application, so OrgManager provides a hosted version you can use **for FREE**. You can access the hosted version at [https://orgmanager.miguelpiedrafita.com](https://orgmanager.miguelpiedrafita.com). In return, please report any bugs you encounter, so we can continue improving!
