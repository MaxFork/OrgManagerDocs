People are the most important part of the code. OrgManager was created to solve a problem, but since then, it has grown into something bigger, and everything was made possible thanks those listed below.

## Authors
* [Miguel Piedrafita](https://miguelpiedrafita.com) is the main developer of OrgManager. He started the project and has coded almost everything.
* [Elio Qoshi](https://elioqoshi.me) designed the OrgManager Branding. We have to thank him for that cool blue tone.
* [Afnizar Nur Ghifari](https://afnizarnur.com) is working in the frontend redesign. OrgManager will look awesome soon thanks to him.
- Obviously, the best thing of Open Source is that anyone can help the project, in one way or another. You can see a list of all the people that collaborated on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgmanager/orgmanager/contributors).
