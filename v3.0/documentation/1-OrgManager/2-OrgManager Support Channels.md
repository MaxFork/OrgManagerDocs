Although a documentation is provided, 

* Github Issues - You can [open an issue](https://github.com/orgmanager/orgmanager/issues/new) for things like requesting new features or reporting bugs.
* Hosted Version Chat - If you've used the hosted version, you might have noticed that there is a chat icon on the bottom right corner. That chat is used for things related to the hosted version.
* [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/orgmanager/) - We have a little Gitter chatroom for discussing things about the project, meeting other users and anything else you think of. Don't be afraid to say hello!
* Email - You can send a mail to [orgmanager@miguelpiedrafita.com](mailto:orgmanager@miguelpiedrafita.com) to discuss anything with the developer team.
