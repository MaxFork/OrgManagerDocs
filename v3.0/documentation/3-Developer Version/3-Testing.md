By default, the tests will run in a special database called `orgmanager_test` in `localhost` with username `root` and password `root`. If you need to change this, edit the `.env.testing` file. This is an example of a customized `.env.testing` file:

``` php
APP_ENV=testing // don't change this!
APP_KEY=base64:GIkaQ57IIVtTeTQOIh7eAFo1FAcoWkfwYPkfcOyusW4= // this is autogenerated

DB_CONNECTION=travis

DB_TEST_HOST=database_host // the testing database host
DB_TEST_DATABASE=database_name // the testing database name
DB_TEST_USERNAME=database_username // the testing database username
DB_TEST_PASSWORD=database_password // the testing database password

CACHE_DRIVER=array // you shouldn't need to change this
SESSION_DRIVER=array // you shouldn't need to change this
QUEUE_DRIVER=sync // you shouldn't need to change this
```

Once you've customized your .env.testing file, you have to migrate the database to your test database. You can do this by running 
``` sh
php artisan migrate --env=testing
```

To run the tests, just run
``` sh
composer test
```
